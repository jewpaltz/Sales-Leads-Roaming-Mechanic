# Sales Playbook - Roaming Mechanic

## Value Proposition
**"We keep your fleet moving by coming to you."**

*   **Convenience:** No shuttling cars to the shop. No paying two employees to drop off one van.
*   **Reduced Downtime:** We service vehicles on-site during your downtime (early morning, late afternoon, or weekends).
*   **Specialization:** Focused on cars and vans (Clean fleet focus).
*   **Direct Communication:** Dealing directly with the mechanic, not a service advisor.

## Preparation (Before the Call/Visit)
1.  **Research:**
    *   Find the company online. Do they have a "Our Team" or "About Us" page? Look for the Owner, General Manager, or Fleet Manager.
    *   Check their fleet size from photos if possible (Facebook/Instagram often show their trucks).
    *   **Verify Vehicle Type:** Ensure they use vans/cars (e.g., Ford Transit, Promaster, Chevy Express) and not just large box trucks/semis.

2.  **Materials:**
    *   Business cards.
    *   Rate sheet / Service menu (Oil change, Brakes, Inspections, General Diagnostics).
    *   Calendar (Digital or Physical) ready to book.

## Cold Call Script

**Gatekeeper (Receptionist):**
> "Hi, I’m [Name] with [Business Name]. We’re a local mobile mechanic service for fleets. Could you point me to whoever handles vehicle maintenance for the company? That might be the Owner or a Fleet Manager."

**Decision Maker:**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Name] with [Business Name]. We're a local mobile mechanic service based in [Your County]."
>
> "The reason I'm calling is we help local businesses save time by servicing their fleet on-site. We effectively eliminate the need to shuttle vans back and forth to a shop."
>
> "We focus specifically on cars and vans like yours. Do you currently have a service solving that for you, or are you still taking them into a shop?"

**If "We have a mechanic":**
> "That’s great. Most of my best clients do. I’m not asking you to switch everything today, but I’d love to be your backup option for when they are booked up or for simple preventative maintenance like oil changes and brakes where you don't want the vehicle off the road for half a day. Would you be open to me dropping off a card just in case?"

**Closing:**
> "I’ll be in [City/Area] on [Day]. Would it be okay if I stopped by for 5 minutes just to introduce myself and see if we might be a good fit down the road?"

## The Drop-In Visit
*   **Goal:** Get your card in the decision-maker's hand and see the vehicles.
*   **Observation:** Look at the lot. Are there vans sitting there? Are they new sales vehicles or older work vans?
*   **Approach:**
    *   Walk in confidently.
    *   "Hi, I'm [Name], the mobile mechanic. Is [Owner's Name] around?"
    *   If not: "No problem. I just wanted to leave some info for them about fleet maintenance. I'll check back next week." (Leave card/flyer).

## Follow-Up Strategy
*   **The "No Answer" Lead:** Call back in 3 days at a different time of day.
*   **The "Dropped By" Lead:** Call 2 days later: "Hi [Name], I stopped by on Tuesday and left some info. Just wanted to make sure you got it and see if you had any questions about our on-site service."
*   **The "Not Interested" Lead:** Add to a "6-month drip". Call back in 6 months. Mechanics change, prices go up, frustrations happen. Be there when they do.
