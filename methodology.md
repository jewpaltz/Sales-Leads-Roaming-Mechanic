# Methodology

#### I'm planning the search for 20 new leads.

Given your new constraints (Cars/Vans ONLY and Maintenance ONLY - no repairs), I am shifting my strategy to target industries that rely on lighter vehicles and high uptime, where "Preventative Maintenance" is the main selling point.

#### I will target:

1. Home Health Care / Visiting Nurses (Fleets of cars, high mileage).
2. Pest Control (Vans/Pickups).
3. Cleaning Services (Cars/Vans).
4. Florists / Bakeries / Catering (Delivery Vans).
5. Pool Services (Vans).
6. Pharmacies with delivery.
I'll avoid heavy construction/landscaping where trucks are common and "repairs" (broken axels, hydraulics) are the main pain point.

#### I have successfully found 20 new leads that strictly fit your "Cars/Vans Only" and "Maintenance Only" criteria.
#### I targeted industries with high-mileage, light-duty fleets:

1. **Home Health**: Visiting Nurse Services (Rockland Ops).
2. **Pest Control**: 8 companies (Eliminate 'Em, Pest Arrest, Bug Runner, Victory, etc.) – Heavy van usage, critical 24/7 uptime.
3. **Cleaning**: Maid Brigade & Merry Maids (Company cars/sedans).
4. **Florists**: 8 top local florists with delivery vans (Bassett, Adams, Monticello, etc.).
5. **Pharmacies**: 2 independent pharmacies with free delivery fleets (TruCare, Prescription Center).

I have created deep research profiles for all of them in the leads/ folder and updated your leads.md index. You are ready to start calling.
