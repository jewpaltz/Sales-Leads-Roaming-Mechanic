# Lead Profile: Dependable Medical Transport

## 🏢 Company Overview
*   **Industry**: Medical Transport / Car Service
*   **Location**: Jeffersonville (Sullivan County)
*   **Fleet Estimate**: Small fleet of cars/vans for patient transport.
*   **Service Area**: Sullivan County -> NYC / Airports. High mileage fleet.

## 🎯 Decision Maker
*   **Name**: *Unknown specific owner name from initial search*
*   **Contact**: (845) 428-1674
*   **Structure**: Likely small business / owner-operator led.

## 🔌 The "In" (Connection Points)
*   **"First-Class" Promise**: Their marketing says "First-Class Car Service".
    *   *Connection*: "You promise a 'first-class' ride. A breakdown with a patient in the back is a nightmare. Preventative maintenance is your insurance policy for that reputation."
*   **Long Distance**: They drive to NYC and airports. High wear and tear.

## 🛠️ Current Maintenance
*   **Status**: Unknown.
*   **Opportunity**: Minimizing downtime.
    *   *Script Adjustment*: "Your vans are your revenue. If they are in the shop, they aren't billing. We service them at your lot during your off-hours (if any) to keep them moving."

## 📝 Notes
*   Sullivan County Chamber member. Use that as a warm intro: "I found you through the Sullivan Chamber..."
*   Verify if they have wheelchair vans (lifts need maintenance too) or just sedans.
