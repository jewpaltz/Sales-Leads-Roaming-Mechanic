# Lead Profile: Visiting Nurse Services (Rockland Ops)

## 🏢 Company Overview
*   **Industry**: Home Healthcare
*   **Location**: Rockland County / Westchester HQ
*   **Fleet Details**: **Known Fleet**. In 2019, they leased a fleet of Subaru Imprezas for clinical staff.
*   **Service Area**: Rockland & Westchester.

## 🎯 Decision Maker
*   **Name**: Jennifer Brullo (CEO) / Operations Director
*   **Role**: Executive leadership.
*   **Constraint**: Corporate structure may require navigating through "Facilities" or "Operations".

## 🔌 The "In" (Connection Points)
*   **Safety Focus**: They bought the fleet to ensure staff safety (Subarus).
    *   *Pitch*: "You invested in Subarus for safety. We invest in maintenance to keep those safety features working. Don't let a mechanic's backlog compromise your staff's safety."
*   **Staff Retention**: They use cars as a retention tool.
    *   *Pitch*: "Your nurses shouldn't be dealing with 'Check Engine' lights. That's our job."

## 🛠️ Current Maintenance
*   **Status**: Likely a fleet management contract (Enterprise?), but "on-site" is a value add.
*   **Opportunity**: Convenience for nurses who take cars home?
    *   *Script Adjustment*: "If your nurses take the cars home, we can service them at the office during team meetings so they don't lose field time."

## 📝 Notes
*   This is a "high volume, low repair" account (Oil changes, tires, inspections). Ideal for the "Maintenance Only" model.
