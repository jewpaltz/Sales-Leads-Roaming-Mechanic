*   **Fleet Details**: **Large Fleet**. Cars/Trucks.
*   **Owner Status**: **Acquired by Terminix/Rentokil** (2021). Corporate owned now.

## 🎯 Decision Maker
*   **Name**: Branch Manager (Local)
*   **Role**: Operations lead for the Sullivan branch.
*   **Contact**: `(800) 287-2847` (Ask for Sullivan Branch).
*   **Constraint**: Corporate might handle fleet contracts (ARI/Enterprise).

## 🔌 The "In" (Connection Points)
*   **Local Gaps**: Even with a national contract, local branches struggle with downtime waiting for "Authorized" shops.
    *   *Pitch*: "I know Rentokil has big contracts. But when you need a quick tire plug, oil change, or bulb swap to get a guy back on the road *today*, those contracts are too slow. Use me as your 'Local Rapid Response'."
*   **Sullivan Geography**: Ferndale is rural. Towing is expensive.
