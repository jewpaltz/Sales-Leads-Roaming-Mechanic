# Lead Profile: Bruni & Campisi

## 🏢 Company Overview
*   **Industry**: Plumbing, HVAC
*   **Location**: Elmsford (Westchester) / Rockland.
*   **Fleet Estimate**: **Large**. "Red Fleet". 40+ years in business.
*   **Service Area**: Westchester / Rockland / CT.

## 🎯 Decision Maker
*   **Name**: Mario Bruni
*   **Role**: Owner / Partner
*   **Family**: Family-owned business.

## 🔌 The "In" (Connection Points)
*   **Brand Image**: Their fleet is ICONIC red trucks.
    *   *Connection*: "Your red trucks are a billboard. If one is broken down on the side of the road, it hurts the brand. We keep them moving."
*   **Emergency Service**: They promise 24/7 service.
    *   *Pitch*: "You offer 24/7 service to your customers. We offer that same level of dedication to your fleet."

## 🛠️ Current Maintenance
*   **Status**: Likely has a structured fleet program, but territory is huge.
*   **Opportunity**: Rockland Coverage.
    *   *Script Adjustment*: "I know your HQ is in Elmsford, but for your trucks running calls in Rockland/Orange, do you want to tow them back across the bridge for service? We handle the Rockland fleet locally."

## 📝 Notes
*   **Strategy**: Focus on the geographical split. Pitch handling the "West of Hudson" vehicles so they don't have to cross the Tappan Zee (Cuomo) Bridge for service.
